## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **self-taught Frontend Developer** from Pakistan with over 4 years of experience and a proven track record of delivering exceptional digital solutions. I've built a reputation for excellence on Fiverr while simultaneously developing innovative products that solve real-world problems.

Currently serving as a Full Stack Engineer at Turingoid since January 2023, where I design, develop, and deploy scalable web applications. I also contribute as a Frontend Developer to WebOptix, a Swiss web design agency, and work on Orderain, an innovative no-code ecommerce platform. Additionally, I'm the creator of multiple successful products including **imgshrnk** (image compression tool) and **FastTempMail** (privacy email service).

I believe in clean architecture, security-first development, and building products that genuinely solve problems. When I'm not crafting digital solutions, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or jamming on my guitar.
